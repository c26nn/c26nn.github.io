            <div class="description">Couscous: Steamed semolina grains with vegetables and meat. <br><strong>Recipe:</strong> In a medium pot, make your couscous according to directions on the package. Bring the water to a boil in the pot with the olive oil before tossing in the couscous, covering and move off the burner completely. Let it sit covered for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork, covering and setting aside.

            In a separate large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat and brown the lamb chunks on all sides before tossing in the onion, bloomed saffron, and seasonings. Sauté until translucent before tossing in the cubed carrots and root veggies and cooking for a couple minutes.

            Once the carrots begins to soften, toss in the zucchini and eggplant. Sauté for another couple minutes before adding minced herbs, tomato sauce and water. Cook over medium heat, slightly covered until all vegetables are cooked through and lamb reaches an internal temperature of 145 (about 20 minutes).

            Add in the garbanzo beans and mix thoroughly, continuing to cook just until they are warm and evenly incorporated. Serve the couscous first, then top carefully with vegetables, finally pouring the broth over the top. Garnish with additional cilantro, parsley, and serve with extra bowls of broth. </div>

            <div class="description">Chicken Tagine: Slow-cooked chicken with spices. <br><strong>Recipe:</strong> Season chicken – Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with the salt.
            Brown chicken – Heat oil the oil in a large, deep skillet or pot (Note 5) over high heat. Place chicken in the skillet skin side down and cook for 8 to 10 minutes until deep golden. Turn and cook the flesh side for 1 minute then remove to a plate.
            Sauté aromatics & spices – Discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium. Add onions and cook for 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the Ras el hanout and stir for 30 seconds.
            Tagine sauce – Add the cinnamon stick, tomato, chickpeas, plumped apricots, stock and preserved lemon, then stir. Place the chicken on top, skin side up.
            Simmer covered 5 minutes – Bring the liquid to a simmer then cover with a lid (Note 6). Cook for 5 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed so the liquid is simmering (but not too rapidly else base may catch).
            Simmer uncovered 20 minutes – Remove lid then cook for a further 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken is at least 70°C/158°F</div>

            Cook the onions & meat. Heat the olive oil in the base of the tagine over medium low heat. Add the diced onion, meat, spices, and herbs. Cook, mixing to combine, until the onions begin to caramelize and the meat browns, about 15-20 minutes.
            Add the onion rounds & tomato. Arrange the remaining onion (cut into rounds), tomato slices, and cinnamon sticks over top of the meat in a circular pattern. 
            Top with sauce & saffron. Pour the bloomed saffron & water over the tagine. Spoon some of the sauce from the base of the tagine over the onions and tomatoes. Bring the liquid to a boil.
            Cover & cook. Cover the tagine with the lid and lower to cook over medium low heat, or until the onions & tomatoes are fork tender and the beef is fully cooked, about an hour.</div>

            <div class="description">Harira: Traditional soup with tomatoes, lentils, and chickpeas. <br><strong>Recipe:</strong> In a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker or stock pot, brown the meat in the oil over medium heat. Add the soup bones, peeled chickpeas, pureed tomatoes, grated onion, spices, smen (if using) and 3 cups (710 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, cover and cook with medium pressure for 25 minutes (or simmer for 50 to 60 minutes).
            Add the lentils, tomato paste mixture, chopped herbs and 8.5 cups (2 liters) water. Bring to a boil and cover.  Continue to step 3 or step 4.
            If planning to add rice, cook the soup with medium pressure for 30 minutes (or simmer for 60 minutes); add the rice, and continue cooking with pressure for another 15 minutes (or 30 minutes by simmering). 
            Taste and adjust seasoning. Thicken the soup to a silky, cream-like consistency by gradually adding the tedouira (flour and water mixture), stirring constantly to ensure that it’s well blended. Use only as much as is needed to make the soup as thick as you like. 
            Simmer the soup for another 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and skimming off any foam that forms on the surface. 
            Remove from the heat and serve. </div>

            <div class="description">M'semen: Flaky, layered flatbread. <br><strong>Recipe:</strong> On a well-oiled surface and with well-oiled hands, pat the first dough ball into a flat circle. Then sweep and stretch the dough circle further to achieve a paper-thin circular shape.
            Distribute 2/3 of one portion of filling across the surface of the dough.
            Fold the dough into thirds like a letter.
            Distribute the remaining 1/3 of the filling on top of the folded dough.
            Fold the two open ends of the dough letter into the center to make a square.
            Set aside and repeat with the other dough balls and filling portions.
            Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. You can use several pans simultaneously to help speed up the process.
            Each msemen maamer now needs to be flattend with oiled hands until nearly double in size. Start with the dough parcel you folded first and in the order you prepared them in. Be careful to ensure that the stuffing doesn’t break through the dough surface.
            Fry the msemen maamer, turning several times, until golden brown.
            Transfer the fried msemen to a wire rack.
            Serve while still warm – best eaten on the same day.</div>

            <div class="description">Chebakia: Honey-soaked sesame cookies. <br><strong>Recipe:</strong> Place your toasted sesame seeds along with your almonds in your food processor and blend until you get fine crumbly texture. The natural oils from your seeds and almonds will make the mixture slightly moister as seen in the picture above.

            Add your flour, spices, butter, oil, sugar, baking powder, yeast and vinegar.

            Blend again until you get a very fine sandy-like texture. All your ingredients should be very well incorporated at this point. Add in your Orange Blossom water and close the lid on your food processor.

            Shape the dough in the shape of the shebakia, fry it, and add warm honey on top along with sesame seeds. Best served warm.
