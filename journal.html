	<h1>	journal entry #1:</h1>


<p>Hi this is noor and this is my journal entry for today (september 21, 2023). This process is basically when the local version of your website uses terminal code and then it will also exist in a remote version. We have connected your local version of your website to the github. What I put on my local version will then be published online.

	<h1>   journal entry #2: </h1>

<p> Hi this is is my second journal entry. Today I learned about tracking mouse and key clicks. We used javascript so that on the web page it showed all the information about the way that I clicked on my key. This makes me think about how social media platforms could use similar code to track pepole's interaction with certain content.

<h1>	journal entry #3:</h1>

<p>This is my journal entry about my code for the project, "make dessert!" This project creates a div called 'ice cream' and then gave it attributes so that it was a specific size and so that the image was contained in the square. Then I used a javascript function to create that div every 100 milliseconds in a row and it will continue infinetly.
